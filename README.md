# vTax Accounting Application

vTax is an accounting software application designed for small businesses, offering an intuitive user interface and essential accounting features. The application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, with a focus on creating a user-friendly experience and providing essential accounting functionalities.

## Project Management & Collaboration

Even though I worked alone on this project, I simulated a team environment by splitting the work into two roles: frontend and backend development. I used the following methodologies:

- **Project Management**: Agile methodology with iterative development cycles.
- **Task Delegation**: Tasks were divided as if managed between two team members, focusing on either the frontend or backend.

## User Interface

The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to individuals with basic accounting knowledge. It features easy navigation and a clean layout, enhancing the user experience.

## User Testing

### Development Environment

Extensive user testing was performed in the development environment to ensure functionality and performance. Feedback was gathered and used to refine the application.

### Production Environment

The application was also tested in the production environment to validate its behavior in a real-world setting with actual colleagues who have experience using other software and family friends without any knowledge. This included testing on different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Testing Framework

- **Jest**: Utilized for unit and integration testing, particularly for the Express.js backend, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase.

## Help

The app includes a help section that informs the user how to navigate and use the application.
